## Product Basics

### What is the Nitro Hat? T
The Nitro Hat is a custom made hi-hat controller designed specifically for the Alesis e-drum kits. It replaces the stock hi-hat pedal, offering realistic playability, full expression (Closed, Half-Open, Open, and Chick sounds), and a natural feel—just like an acoustic hi-hat. Is the Nitro Hat compatible with my Alesis Nitro/Nitro Max? Yes! The Nitro Hat is designed to work with the Alesis Nitro and Nitro Max e-drum kits.

### Is the Nitro Hat compatible with other Alesis models? 
Maybe. Over time I will build a list badsed on feedback from users, you can find it [here](https://lorenz-s.github.io/NitroHat/TheNitroHat)
Do you have other kits and you want to try it? contact me!

### What makes the Nitro Hat better than the stock hi-hat pedal? 
The Nitro Hat will allow you to use a real hi-hat pedal with the Nitro/Nitro Max module. 
The original pedal is very to difficult to play, you either have to press very hard to get a closed sound or it is impossibe to have a half-open sound. 
By using a real hi-hat pedal you will play with natural response—no more over-pressing the pedal. It’s built to mimic the feel of a real hi-hat, so you can play expressively without frustration.

### Is the hi-hat stand included? 
Currently no, you can only order the hi-hat controller, you will have to order the stand yourself. Many stands are compatible.

## Installation

### Can I use the Nitro Hat with any standard hi-hat pedal? 
Yes! The Nitro Hat is designed to fit standard hi-hat pedals, so you can use it with the pedal you already own. 
The only thing you need to make sure is that the Hi-hat clutch bolt is M10 or M12. See picture for reference.

During the order, you will have to specify the bolt size and I will ship the right one to you.

### How do I install the Nitro Hat? 
Installation is simple! The Nitro Hat mounts directly onto your standard hi-hat pedal. Just attach it, connect the cable to your Alesis module, and you’re ready to play. No special tools or technical skills are required.
