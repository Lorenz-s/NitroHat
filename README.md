### The Story Behind Nitro Hat

**From Frustration to Innovation**

Hi, I’m Lorenzo—a drummer, electronics engineer, and the creator of the Nitro Hat. About a year ago, I picked up an **Alesis Nitro Max** to start learning drums. But there was one major issue: **the stock hi-hat pedal**. It felt nothing like the real thing. I had to press way too hard just to get a closed sound, and the overall experience was far from the natural feel of the hi-hat pedal I used during my drum lessons.

**No Solutions, So I Built One**

I looked for alternatives, but unfortunately, the Nitro model doesn’t support other hi-hat controllers. That’s when I decided to take matters into my own hands. As an electronics engineer, I saw an opportunity to create something better.

After many iterations, testing, and tweaking, I finally got it right. The **Nitro Hat** is now mounted on a standard hi-hat pedal, delivering a **realistic, responsive feel**—just like an acoustic hi-hat should.

**From Reddit to Reality**

I shared my creation on Reddit, and the response was overwhelming. Three drummers volunteered to be beta testers, and I shipped them the first units. Since the feedback was incredibly positive, so I made a few final improvements and decided to take the next step: **a small-batch production**.

**Join the First Batch**

That’s why I launched this pre-order campaign. I want to see if there are at least **10 drummers** out there who, like me, are ready to upgrade their Alesis Nitro experience. If you’re tired of the stock hi-hat and want to play with real expression, **the Nitro Hat is for you**.
