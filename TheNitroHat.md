## **What is it?**
![NitroHat-Hardware](https://github.com/Lorenz-s/NitroHat/raw/main/images/IMG_20260112_170646.jpg)

The Nitro Hat is a **hi-hat controller** specifically designed for the Alesis Nitro and Nitro Max electronic drumkits.
It is intented to replace the DMhat Open/Close pedal provided with the drumkit:

**Why?**
Because the original pedal is in no way shape of form the same of a original hi-hat, and it require very difficult movements or high forces to get the right sound out of the hi-hat.
Playing with the original pedal is not like playing with a real drumnkit, and I really wanted to have the feeling of a real hi-hat with my Alesis edrums.

**How does it work?**
It's actually very simple, the original pedal is changing resistance valies based on how you press on it.
I just designed the hardware to change resistance based on the movement of a real hi-hat stand!
While it took a lot of time to fine tune it, the end result is a simple but effective hi-hat controller that gets mounted directly on a standard hi-hat stand.

## **Hi-Hat Stands Compatibility**

You learn so many things when you buld new stuff! For example one could imagine that all hi-hats use standard mounting dimesions for mounting the cymbals.

**Wrong.** there is nothing really standard in our world.

I designed the original version of the Nitro Hat to work with a Pulse hi-hat pedal I purchased used locally. But in the meantime I sourced another couple of hi-hats to test whith.
This is when I found that mounting bolts on the clutches can be different in size.

I now have a M10 and M12 version, these two versions seem to cover a vast majority of hi-hat stands.

The goal of the preorder campain is to collect enough money to purchase different stands and test. Do you want me to test with a specific hi-hat? Contact me!
