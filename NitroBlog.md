### Updates on the Nitro Hat project


### 03-02-2026 - New Element Space for the Nitro Hat
A lot of questions are coming via email and via reddit chat, I dediced it's time to have a proper community around the project.
Discord is great for this, but Element is better since it's opensource, secure and encrypted.
You can make and account and easily join the Nitro Hat Element Space by clicking [here](https://matrix.to/#/#nitrohat:matrix.org)

### 02-02-2026 - The Nitro Hat Website
Since many people asked for it, I decided a small documentation website for the Nitro Hat.
The goal is to collect all the information here, as a reference.
If you have any suggestions, feel free to contact me!
