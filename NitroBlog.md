### Updates on the Nitro Hat project


### 26-02-2026 - Nitro Hat works with the Alesis Nitro Pro model
Thanks to Agnese for sending out a Nitro Pro pedal for test.
I can confirm that inside the pedals are identical, only the exterior is different so **the Nitro Hat works with the Alesis Nitro Pro**.

### 19-02-2026 - we made it!
I'm happy to share that the minimum amount of pledgers for the Nitro Hat has been reached!
The Nitro Hat will happen, there are still 18 days for pre-orderig but I will not lose any time and start preparing for the finalization and production of the first batch!
Thank you everyone who is backing me in this project! Keep an eye here for updates!

### 17-02-2026 - only 2 pledgers needed!
With 20 days left, we are at 8 pledgers out of the minumum 10! So happy to see people interested.
In the meantime I recorded myself testing the Nitro Hat and playing a bit: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ip2vcaMDBV4" target="_blank">Watch it here</a>

Disclamer, I'm a very begineer, no judgment please :)

### 05-02-2026 - Testing Hi-Hats
![hihats](https://i.redd.it/q5nnc50kibhg1.jpeg)

While the preorder campaign is progressing well, I'm looking at a new hi-hat stand for the Nitro. That's why I decided to order two very nice stands from Thomann and test them with the hat!
I discovered a lot, and I updated the [Nitro Hat page](https://lorenz-s.github.io/NitroHat/TheNitroHat) with useful info.
Do you own a hi-hat stand already? Are you willing to help by providing the dimensions? Contact me!

### 03-02-2026 - New Element/Matrix.org Space for the Nitro Hat
A lot of questions are coming via email and via reddit chat, I dediced it's time to have a proper community around the project.
Discord is great for this, but Element is better since it's opensource, secure and encrypted.
You can make and account and easily join the Nitro Hat Element Space by clicking [here](https://matrix.to/#/#nitrohat:matrix.org)

### 02-02-2026 - The Nitro Hat Website
Since many people asked for it, I decided a small documentation website for the Nitro Hat.
The goal is to collect all the information here, as a reference.
If you have any suggestions, feel free to contact me!
