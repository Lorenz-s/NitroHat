### Updates on the Nitro Hat project



### 17-02-2026 - only 2 pledgers needed!
With 20 days left, we are at 8 pledgers out of the minumum 10! So happy to see people interested.
In the meantime I recorded myself testing the Nitro Hat and playing a bit: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ip2vcaMDBV4" target="_blank">Watch it here</a>

Disclamer, I'm a very begineer, no judgment please :)

### 05-02-2026 - Testing Hi-Hats
![hihats](https://i.redd.it/q5nnc50kibhg1.jpeg)

While the preorder campaign is progressing well, I'm looking at a new hi-hat stand for the Nitro. That's why I decided to order two very nice stands from Thomann and test them with the hat!
I discovered a lot, and I updated the [Nitro Hat page](https://lorenz-s.github.io/NitroHat/TheNitroHat) with useful info.
Do you own a hi-hat stand already? Are you willing to help by providing the dimensions? Contact me!

### 03-02-2026 - New Element/Matrix.org Space for the Nitro Hat
A lot of questions are coming via email and via reddit chat, I dediced it's time to have a proper community around the project.
Discord is great for this, but Element is better since it's opensource, secure and encrypted.
You can make and account and easily join the Nitro Hat Element Space by clicking [here](https://matrix.to/#/#nitrohat:matrix.org)

### 02-02-2026 - The Nitro Hat Website
Since many people asked for it, I decided a small documentation website for the Nitro Hat.
The goal is to collect all the information here, as a reference.
If you have any suggestions, feel free to contact me!
